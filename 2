"""A libusb1-based ADB reimplementation.

ADB was giving us trouble with its client/server architecture, which is great
for users and developers, but not so great for reliable scripting. This will
allow us to more easily catch errors as Python exceptions instead of checking
random exit codes, and all the other great benefits from not going through
subprocess and a network socket.

All timeouts are in milliseconds.
